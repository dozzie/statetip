    group of values
    value group
        A set of *values* that have the same meaning, but which were possibly
        collected at different places (see *group origin*) and concern
        different monitored objects. Identified by *group name*.

        related values
            Group of related values is collected at some *origin* at once,
            expires at once, and changes at once. If a list of *value keys*
            changes, the *keys* that were present but are missing should
            disappear from StateTip as soon as possible.

            List of network interfaces of a server is a good example of
            a group of related values.

        unrelated values
            *Values* from a group of unrelated values don't form a meaningful
            set, apart from telling the same thing about similar objects. Each
            value changes and expires independently of the others.

            An example of such values is expiry time of X.509 certificates
            installed on a server. Unlike with network interfaces, a *value*
            for an old certificate doesn't need to disappear immediately with
            next reading of certs' statuses.

    group name
        Name of a *value group*.

    group origin
    value origin
        Place (source) where some of the *values* in a *value group* were
        collected from. *Value group* can consist of *values* from many
        origins.

        Hostname usually makes a good origin. Origin may also be ``null`` if
        there is no meaningful distinction where the *value* was collected
        from.

    log file
    state log file
        Append-only binary file that records every *value* change or
        expiration. Log file is used to restore *values* after StateTip
        restart.

        log compaction
            Process of reading all *log records*, discarding the ones that
            were replaced by newer ones, and writing a new *log file* with
            only the newest *records*.

            Part of this process is *replaying* the compacted *log file*.

        log record
            Block of binary data that describes a new state of *value* (its
            group name, origin, key, state, expiry time, etc.) or marks that
            the value expired or changed in some other way.

        log replaying
            Process of reading *records* from a *log file* and applying
            changes they describe to a data structure, so that the result
            reflects the state of all the *values* in StateTip at the time of
            writing the *log file*.

    reader client
        Program that extracts data out of StateTip through :ref:`StateTip
        reader protocol <reader-protocol>`.

    sender client
        Program that sends values to StateTip through :ref:`StateTip sender
        protocol <sender-protocol>`.

    value
        Last remembered state of some object that is being observed
        (monitored), usually collected for displaying on a dashboard or
        providing a listing what objects are monitored.

        Consists of *group name*, *origin*, *key*, *state*, and some metadata.

        key
            "Name" of a value. Together with *group name* and *origin*
            identifies particular value.

        state
            Textual representation of the actual status of the monitored
            object, e.g. "up"/"down" for server's availability. Can be
            ``null`` for values collected for the sake of keeping an inventory
            of objects.

        severity
            Conformity of the *state* with expectations. One of the three
            values: "expected", "warning", "error".

These terms are only used in source code:

    value group registry
        Process that keeps track of *value group keeper* processes.

    value group keeper
        Process that remembers *values* of specific *origin* from a *value
        group*. Registered in *value group registry* process under a name
        built of *group name* and *origin*.

    state logger
        Process responsible for writing changes in *values* to a *log file*
        and for periodical *compaction* of the file.
